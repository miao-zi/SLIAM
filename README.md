## A segmentation-based hierarchical feature interaction attention model for gene mutation status identification in colorectal cancer
## 1.introduction
In this paper, we propose a Segmentation-based Hierarchical feature Interaction Attention Model (SHIAM) that synergizes multi-task leaming with hierarchical feature integration, aiming to achieve accurate prediction of the KRAS gene mutation status.
