## A segmentation-based hierarchical feature interaction attention model for gene mutation status identification in colorectal cancer
## 1.introduction
In this paper, we propose a Segmentation-based Local-global Information Interaction Attention Model(SLIAM) to predict patients' KRAS gene mutation status with the segmentation task facilitating the classification task.
## 2.Requirement
PyTorch='1.7.2'
